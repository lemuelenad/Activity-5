Activity 5 - Memory, Memory Testing and Peripheral

Lemuel Jay B. Enad BSCPE 4A

1. Why do we need to perform memory testing?
   
  > The purpose of a memory test is to confirm that each storage location in a memory device is working as well as controlling and coordinating a computer's main memory. This ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.


2. Implement the following using C/C++
> Checksum (https://github.com/lemuelenad/Activity-5/tree/main/Checksum)

> CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check (https://github.com/lemuelenad/Activity-5/tree/main/CRC%20(Cyclic%20Redundancy%20Check)
